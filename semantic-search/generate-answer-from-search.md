## Answer Generation Functions

This code block contains two functions that can be used to generate answers to questions using the Cohere API.

### `generate_answer`

This function takes a CohereAPI object, a question, and a paragraph as input and returns an answer to the question based on the given paragraph.

#### Parameters

* `co` (`CohereAPI`): A CohereAPI object for generating answers.
* `question` (`str`): The question to be answered.
* `paragraph` (`str`): The paragraph to be used as context.

#### Returns

* `str`: The generated answer.

### `generate_better_answer`

This function takes a CohereAPI object, a question, and a list of candidate answers as input and returns a better answer based on the list of candidates and the given question.

#### Parameters

* `co` (`CohereAPI`): A CohereAPI object for generating answers.
* `question` (`str`): The question to be answered.
* `answers` (`List[str]`): A list of candidate answers.

#### Returns

* `str`: The generated answer.

### `display_results`

This function takes a query, a pandas dataframe, and a CohereAPI object as input, and generates answers to the query using the `generate_answer` and `generate_better_answer` functions.

#### Parameters

* `query` (`str`): The query to be used to generate answers.
* `results` (`pd.DataFrame`): A pandas dataframe containing the text to be used as context for generating answers.
* `co` (`CohereAPI`): A CohereAPI object for generating answers.

#### Returns

* `str`: The generated answer.

### Example Usage

```python
from cohere import CohereAPI
import pandas as pd

# create a CohereAPI object
co = CohereAPI('<API_KEY>')

# create a dataframe with some text
df = pd.DataFrame({'id': [1, 2],
                   'text': ['This is some text that we want to use as context for answering questions.',
                            'This is another piece of text that can be used for generating answers.']})

# display the results using the display_results function
answer = display_results('What is this text about?', df, co)

# print the result
print(answer)
